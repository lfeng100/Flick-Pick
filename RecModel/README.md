Steps to train model:
1. Extract datasets to /raw/
2. Run prep_data.py
3. run train.py

Or you can download the prepared datasets and pretrained model [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Qyxc8nsFuLJ76knzpUGfneqgnS4aSZyY?usp=drive_link):
1. Extract prepared datasets to /data/
2. Extract model to this directory

Then, running driver.py will give a command line interface into the model
